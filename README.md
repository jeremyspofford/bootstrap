# dotfiles

Run the following commands and respond to prompts generated by the script.

Expected prompts:
  1. Email - for setting up the email used in github to switch to ssh-keygen instead of user/password auth to github.
  2. Enter to continue - after the ssh-key is generated, and you've copied it to your ssh keys in github, hit enter to continue.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeremyspofford/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/init.sh
```
