# dotfiles

This is currently configured to setup the below modules and dotfile:

- .zshrc (default - and other zsh dotfiles)
- oh-my-zsh
- mise
- neovim
- git
- [stow](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) (for dotfile symlinks )

The following modules and dotfiles are optional (and possibly not ready yet). They'll be pulled, but not configured to be active.

- bashrc (replaced by zsh, but you can change back to bash with `chsh -s /bin/bash`)
- starship
- tmux
- kitty
- themes
- [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)

Run the following commands and respond to prompts generated by the script.

Expected prompts:
  1. Email - for setting up the email used in github to switch to ssh-keygen instead of user/password auth to github.
  2. Enter to continue - after the ssh-key is generated, and you've copied it to your ssh keys in github, hit enter to continue.
  3. 1Password CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeremyspofford/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/init.sh
```
